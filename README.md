# Wordathon

Wordathon is a wordle-like game. Like wordle, the user has six attempts to guess a word.
Letters which are unused are grey. Misplaced letters are yellow. And correct letters are green. 
Unlike wordle, the game doesn't end after correctly guessing one word. 
Instead, the user to challenged to guess as many words in possible to get a high streak.
Additionally, wordathon features difficulty levels and sound effects.
